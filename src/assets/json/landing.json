    "paragraph": "<p>Hi there - my name is Courtney Ring and I'm a technology lead with experience building web applications based in New York City. I have worked in the industry for seven years and have had the opportunity to be involved in a variety of projects ranging from corporate websites to in-person digital activations. I enjoy getting my hands on new projects to figure out innovative solutions and I thrive on the deadlines, along with the feeling of accomplishment that comes when projects are deployed. </p><p>My professional life has been 100% driven by my passion for marketing and advertising in the digital world. I started my career at Cigna working on its public facing websites to attract and inform clients and customers. After two years, I said goodbye to Cigna and moved to New York for my first gig in the agency world. I accepted a role at <a href='https://vaynermedia.com/' target='_blank'>VaynerMedia</a> as a frontend developer on the adtech team, now known as <a href='https://tracer.tech/' target='_blank'>Tracer</a>. While I worked there, my biggest contribution was developing a user interface that was both beautiful and usable, including the incorporation of data visualization and mobile responsiveness. As much as I enjoyed the role, I had a longing to expand my skills past frontend development, which led me to <a href='http://www.imagination.com' target='_blank'>Imagination</a>. Imagination gave me the opportunity to develop across many different technologies, clients, and experiences. My projects ranged from sensor triggered recording apps to at-home AR experiences to on-site user journey tracking. The role also allowed me to wear multiple hats, as I help out in project management and production technology when needed.</p><p>I'm now working at <a href='https://criticalmass.com' target='_blank'>Critical Mass</a> as a technology lead. This job has expanded my leadership skills in more ways than I can count. As a very multi-faceted role, I have my hands in the project for the full life cycle - from creative brainstorming to go-live. I collaborate with design, copy, marketing science, and search to ensure we have all resources needed for development and that those resources are aligned. And once those items are in place, I manage development teams providing technical guidance, code reviews, and project management.</p><p>Through my experience as a tech lead and background in events, I have realized that this is the niche of the tech space that I truly love. I get genuine satisfaction out of managing projects that are seen in the real world and watching users experience the surprise and delight factor we aim to provide during every activation. I hope to continue growing my skills in this area going forward.</p>"
