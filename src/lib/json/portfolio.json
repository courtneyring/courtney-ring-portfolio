Imagination designed and built an obstacle course ending with “The Mountain” to showcase the Bronco’s peak incline and decline angles.</p><p>The Mach-E is Ford’s electric sports car with an impressive ability to accelerate from 0-60 in 3.5 seconds. With this same desire to show off peak performance, Ford had a runway for drivers to put the pedal to the metal and allow participants to feel the speed for themselves.</p><p>In both cases, Ford wanted customers to have a digital souvenir to go home with to remember these experiences. So as part of the activation, we built an application that records visitors’ reaction at the exact moment of surprise and delight and programmatically edit the video for a keepsake they could view and share afterwards.</p>",

We used a python script on a raspberry pi to read and process these numbers continuously. We used the accelerometer readings directly for the Mach-E, but the Bronco needed data on the incline angle of the car, so we used the data from both sensors and the complimentary filter to combine them into an incline angle.</p><p>All of this data was then sent to the video recording application running on a laptop, also in stored in the trunk of the car. The application was connected to a webcam attached to the dashboard that recorded the participants in the back seat. As the vehicle hit incline, decline, and acceleration thresholds, the video application recorded timestamps. Once the ride ended, the video and timestamps were then passed off to the video processing application.</p><p>The backend which received these requests and did the video processing was run on a physical server kept in back of house.  The video processing application itself was run in a docker container on a virtual machine on that server. The application used a node backend to queue jobs using rabbitmq as they came in from the frontend and a node worker to process each job. Ffmpeg was used to splice the video at the given timestamps, add clips of stock video, audio, and a layover. It then sent the final product to Amazon S3 for storage and an email to the user for them to view and share.</p>",

Our part in the overhaul was to ensure all Infiniti Shopping Tools pages followed the new brand guideline for both the American and Canadian markets.

I provided estimates for frontend tasks to help inform prioritization, scheduling, and resourcing. From there, we agreed on key milestones for each application to ensure we hit our target date and demo progress to the clients. For the development phase, I led a team of two developers and two QA analysts to complete the project in just under four months. The  process also required coordination with the AEM and content management teams as we worked through dependencies. The initial production release was done on June 22, 2023, with rolling releases afterward for subsequent milestones.",

In contrast to the rest of the site - mostly made up of static pages - they wanted something interactive and dynamic that customers could use to explore all angles of the QX60.</p><p>The biggest challenge in the project brief was load time expectations. The client was planning on making it the landing page of the QX60, a page that was crucial to user journey. The higher the load time, the higher the bounce rate, ending a user’s journey before it even starts. So having the site load in under a few seconds was a non-negotiable.</p>",

We had to find a way to give the users a similar experience without the overhead of big files. So instead we turned to video. We collaborated with motion designers to define the movements of the QX60 model for each page transition. Those segments were combined into a single video, which we used as the primary asset on the site. Using GSAP ScrollTrigger and scroll snap, we scrubbed the video based on scroll progress and overlaid hotspot at each stopping point. The outcome was everything a 3D experience could provide without the incorporation of actual 3D components.",
